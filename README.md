# platformer
A platforming game with level editor. My first major coding project.

Features:
  - level editor:
    - create, save, and edit levels (saved as text files)

  - game:
    - load levels created by the level editor
    - player movement (left/right, jumping, gravity)
    - collision (player can collide with all solid rectangles placed by the level editor)

I used the 'turtle' module to handle graphics (part of the standard python library)
